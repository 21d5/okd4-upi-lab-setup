# okd4-UPI-Lab-Setup
Installing OKD4.X with User Provisioned Infrastructure.  Libvirt, iPXE, and FCOS

## WIP - This documentation is nearing completion, but is not fully tested yet.  I have written it from my own lab configuration, but have not yet run through these instructions from scratch.  If you are brave, then go ahead and give it a try.  Open issues if you encounter problems.  Otherwise, check back often for progress.
